## Introduction

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner. It comes with docker containers making installation trivial and results highly reproducible.

## Quick Start

1. Install [`nextflow`](https://nf-co.re/usage/installation)

2. Install either [`Docker`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) or [`Singularity`](https://www.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/) for full pipeline reproducibility _(please only use [`Conda`](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) as a last resort; see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#basic-configuration-profiles))_

3. Download the pipeline and test it on a minimal dataset with a single command:

    ```bash
    nextflow run lifebit-ai/simulate -profile test,<docker/singularity/conda/institute>
    ```

    > Please check [nf-core/configs](https://github.com/nf-core/configs#documentation) to see if a custom config file to run nf-core pipelines already exists for your Institute. If so, you can simply use `-profile <institute>` in your command. This will enable either `docker` or `singularity` and set the appropriate execution settings for your local compute environment.

4. Start running your own analysis!

    <!-- TODO nf-core: Update the example "typical command" below used to run the pipeline -->

    ```bash
    nextflow run lifebit-ai/simulate -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> --input '*_R{1,2}.fastq.gz' --genome GRCh37
    ```

See [usage docs](docs/usage.md) for all of the available options when running the pipeline.

## Documentation

The lifebit-ai/simulate pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline which you can read at [https://lifebit-ai/simulate/docs](https://lifebit-ai/simulate/docs) or find in the [`docs/` directory](docs).

<!-- TODO nf-core: Add a brief overview of what the pipeline does and how it works -->

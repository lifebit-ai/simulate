# Simulation pipeline

## 1 - Introduction

This pipeline performs simulations of various genomics datasets. It is is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io), a workflow tool to run tasks across multiple compute infrastructures in a very portable manner.

## 2 - Quick Start

```
nextflow run main.nf --num_participants 40
```

## 3 - Documentation

The lifebit-ai/simulate pipeline comes with documentation about the pipeline which you can find in the [`docs/`](docs).
